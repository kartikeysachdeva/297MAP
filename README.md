# Map-Go-Brr

A GIS (Geographic Information System) software that displays maps and relevant information (street names, point of interests, subways etc.) for various major cities around the world. The project was created in C++ and uses APIs based on OSM (Open Street Maps) data. The graphics were created using EZGL Graphics Library in addition to GTK and Glade.

This project was created with a team of two other members for ECE297 which is a course at the University of Toronto on software design and communication. As part of the course guidelines, the source code cannot be publicly shared, however, a detailed description and final software images are given below.
